 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was cold. Too cold, despite it being quite hot and sunny outside for a day in June. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was silent. Too silent, despite there being dozens of patients and nurses walking outside in the hallways: some pushing wheelchairs, and others pushing carts with medicine. 
<br> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	It was 5:30 am, and I usually would’ve been in bed. The annoying ring of the home phone woke me up from my light sleep; I had not been able to sleep adequately for days, as my eyes refused to close shut, and my brain refused to let me rest, as it was still revolving around my struggle to accept reality. <br>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ring...ring...ring...</i> Three times. A fourth. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I dragged myself out of my bed, still groggy with bags under my eyes, annoyed by the anonymous call – “Hello?”... On the other side of the phone, with her monotonous tone – the most traumatic voice I’ve ever heard – a dark, unwomanly, even mechanical-like voice informed me to come pick my dad’s things up, as he was “gone.” The phone slipped out of my hand onto the floor. I left it there, not caring to hang up. I stood there for a minute – maybe two, I lost track of time – with my mouth wide open, and my lips and fingers trembling, forgetting to breathe. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <i>This all must be a lie. They must be calling the wrong number.</i><sup> <b>1</b></sup> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forcing my feet to move to my mom’s room, I shook my mom, who was curled up like a small ball on her bed, awake with my trembling hands. I squeezed out my miserable voice to tell my mom, her eyes red and poofed up from the tears of the night before, that my dad was... dead. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	My dad had just been hospitalized 10 days before, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We were told that he had 3 months to live, and even hearing that was shocking. Never did we expect him to pass away so early.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Entering his hospital room, I felt the air get thinner. I had trouble breathing. My own heartbeat drowned out the sounds of the hallways. The bland, white room nearly blinded me.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	He looked as though he was simply asleep on his deathbed: slightly smiling, eyes closed... but his hands were so cold and stiff – enough to make me shiver. It was no joke. He really was gone. He was right there – but he was forever gone. He would forever stay 42.<sup><b>2</b></sup> I felt powerless as I sat beside his bed. I was young when he left: the 12 year-old me was too young to be able to do anything, but old enough to understand the pain of losing someone dear to you.<br><br>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	A few days later, I was sitting right in front of his coffin. It was his funeral, and I couldn’t help but feel mesmerized by the number of people: from friends, family, to people I couldn’t recall the faces of. <br>    
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Each and every person came walking up to my mom and I, and repeated the same words: <br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I’m sorry for your loss.” <br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“I hope you’re doing okay.” <br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
“He will be missed.” <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <i>Yeah right. I doubt any of you actually think that.</i><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I was annoyed by how everyone kept saying the same things, as if they were a programmed robot. I knew that no one would actually understand the pain my mom and I were going through.<sup><b>3</b></sup> The eyes of sympathy that the people looked at me with were simply uncomfortable – somewhat disgusting, even.<br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	My dad didn’t look like the dad I knew in his coffin: he had white makeup put on him, red lipstick, and a black suit, which he would never have worn if he were alive, on him. People had put origami cranes inside in addition to flowers and several things he used to use.<sup><b>4</b></sup> Seeing him with all the makeup and flowers distracted me from hearing the conversations that were going on inside the funeral, and kept me from tugging on hems of the tight, confining black suit that I had been forced to wear. <br><br>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	My dad was now dead. My mom, who had been a housewife, was now out for work.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Meanwhile, me?<br><br>

	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was lost. Severely lost.<br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      And knowing that I was going to be stuck in a new environment – Stuyvesant – wasn’t making anything better. </p>
