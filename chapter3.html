	One of the only hobbies and talents that I have is the piano. I started playing when I was seven, and have continued for 10 years (as of now). My favorite composers consist of Chopin and Prokofiev, and I personally dislike Mozart. He’s too metronomical and boring for my tastes (sorry Mozart fans). <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	There’s a proper reason why I consider piano not only as a hobby, but also as one of my talents: I’ve won in competitions, passed through auditions, and was a student at Manhattan School of Music Precollege (in fact, I just graduated in May). I honestly can’t do much else other than the piano, so consequently, it’s one of the only talents I have.<sup> <b>1</b></sup> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Playing for 10 or so years, and at a decently high level, I’ve come to one conclusion: we pianists are lone wolves.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Pianists are lone wolves. Unlike orchestral instrumentalists, we pianists are constantly alone, whether it be during practice, on a spotlighted stage, or even backstage. No one can cover up for the mistakes you make, nor are you allowed to look at the score as you perform. The only things that we can rely on are our two ears, hands, and feet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	That’s why I had always played piano for myself. Well, perhaps also because I just didn’t know how to “play” for people.<sup><b>2</b></sup> The black and white keys, the elongating pedal, and the tiny notes on the score were for me, and me only. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <i>Never did I know that my perspective would experience a 180 degree change. </i><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The summer of my sophomore year, I was accepted by an audition into the renowned Boston University Tanglewood Institute “Young Artists Piano Program” (BUTI). The 16 talented and skilled students from all over the states stayed in a dorm at Lenox, Massachusetts while having master classes, chamber lessons, and weekly concerts. We were placed in the middle of the woods, with barely any functioning Wi-Fi, frequent wild bear alerts, and practice shacks with dozens of dead moths.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 For the first few days, the students seemed nervous and didn't speak much. After repeatedly having group discussions, however, I gradually gained the courage to befriend them. By the end of the first week, my fellow “piano-mates” and I were practicing in front of each other, analyzing musical scores, sharing advice or constructive criticism, or going to the ice cream parlor together on a day off. It was the first time I was able to meet talented pianists of my age capable of critiquing and helping each other improve. Under these influences, even my playing began to alter: it became more expressive, more open, and more for a “wide audience.” I recognized how marvelous it felt to play with others. We often gathered and had lively conversations about experiences and commonalities only pianists understand. Listening to the others, it became clear that we had all felt like lone wolves as pianists. We 16 wolves became tied with a stronger bond, making our time at BUTI more valuable. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	While being in BUTI, one of the events I enjoyed was the outreach concerts, where we would visit a nursing home to perform. Of course, I had performed a countless number of times in front of an audience before then. However, those performances had a clear objective: I played to win a prize in a competition, and to awe the crowd in a concert. The outreach concerts, meanwhile, allowed me to play for pure enjoyment and entertain the people in the nursing home. Seeing the elders smile brightly and applaud warmly made my heart pound in satisfaction and joy. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I had always played the piano for myself, dancing my fingers across the keyboard for my lone satisfaction.<sup><b>3</b></sup> However, those precious experiences made me come to understand that piano is meant for everyone. Sure, pianists may be lone wolves, but even we can become a full-fledged pack, and spread the beauty of music with our own two hands. <br><br>	
      <center>*******</center><br><br></p>
      <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    
 When I had lost my dad, I was mentally prepared to no longer be able to play the piano, since learning the instrument costs a lot of money. I was to quit piano and nothing seemed to hold meaning anymore. But as I threw tantrums on the keys, and spent hours thinking of nothing as I blankly stared at my scores, a new will began to grow in me. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wanted to do something to help others. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wanted to lend a hand, an ear, a heart to someone in need. Though I might only be able to cause the smallest, most insignificant change, no matter how big the change would be, I wanted to help make it happen. That method, for me, was through music. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Speaking to my mom and to my piano mentor, I was exposed to the true reason for why I wanted to continue the piano: it was my own form of justice. It might be wrong for me to be continuing the piano when I’m cutting off my family’s savings, but I plan on continuing piano so that I can spread my music to possibly help someone in the future.<br><br> 
          <center>*******</center><br><br></p>
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I have confidence in understanding people’s pain after everything I’ve gone through, and have become a more open-minded and open-hearted pianist after my experience at BUTI. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	So, what have I become? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I’ve become just a bit better.<sup><b>4</b></sup>
