 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I dislike crowds of people. Having so many individuals in a single, cramped place is not somewhere I belong. And in that sense, the first day of school at Stuyvesant was a nightmare for me. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	No matter where I looked, there were people, people, people – snaking through students chatting on the Tribeca Bridge to the double doors, getting lost in the hallways with other freshmen searching for their homeroom, and getting pushed by everyone’s fat backpacks in the staircases made me feel sick. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	It seemed like everyone already had at least one friend with them, and though seemingly nervous, everyone looked quite excited and anxious for their first day of school. I was the polar opposite of such people: I had lost a large portion of my “bright” personality since the incident, and had stopped being in contact with my middle school friends.<sup> <b>1</b></sup> Though there were students from my middle school in Stuy, I never tried to speak to them. I honestly didn’t care about what high school I attended, and I sincerely just wanted to go home.<br><br> 
      
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	My day started off with Freshman Composition with Mr. Henderson. Dragging my heavy-ass backpack and legs through the stairs to the 8th floor since, as always, the escalators weren’t working, I waited outside the room, glancing around the hallway to see who my new classmates were. Not that I recognized anyone. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Upon entering the room, I was quite taken aback by what I saw: a blackboard instead of a smartboard like my middle school had used, huge windows on the right side of the room which let me see the Hudson River, tables placed in a oval-like fashion rather than the traditional rows and columns, and a tall, bearded, warmly smiling teacher with black-framed glasses. The classroom was different from the classical educational setting I had grown up with; it felt freer, and more open. Though it was a bit chilly in the room, I found it to be more comfortable than  what I had expected.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	That was when nightmare part two arrived. Ice-breakers. Introductions. <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Now, I know that these so-called “ice-breakers” are a necessary part of the first-day of class for students and the teacher to get to know each other (well, if I must say, “ice-breakers” don’t break the ice. It makes the air freeze more). But, similar to my hatred for crowds, or perhaps more than that, I hate doing introductions.<sup><b>2</b></sup> <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	We were asked to rip a page out of our notebooks to use as a name plate, and fold it so that it would be able to stand on the top of the corner of our tables. Annoyed on the inside for having to do this, I grabbed a page out of my spiral notebook and roughly folded it into a triangle, writing and boldening my name with a pen for the gazillionth time.<sup><b>3</b></sup> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Introductions started from the students sitting in the inner circle. The names went on… Ethan, Rebecca, Ian, Ethan (again)... It took some time for my turn to come up, since I was sitting in a chair in the outer circle. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Looking at me with a smile, Mr Henderson called, “Okay, so next… Lynca!”<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Frankly, I was surprised by the fact that he got the proper pronunciation of my name on his first try. Until then, practically ALL of my teachers had gotten my name wrong. Frequently they mistook it for “Lyn-sa,” pronouncing the “-ca” like a “-sa” rather than a “-ka,” or in worse cases, they called me “Line-ka,” literally saying “line” rather than “Lyn.” There was also an incident where a teacher called me “Lime-ca,” which I don’t know where they got the idea from. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Anyway, I began my introduction: the regular drill of “Hi, my name is Lynca,” my hobbies, talents, favorite color, whatnot – then hearing the other students clap.<sup><b>4</b></sup> I just wanted to get it over with, since I knew no one would be listening or have any interest anyway. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I was proven wrong. After finishing everyone’s introductions, Mr. Henderson asked students if there was anything about anyone that they liked hearing about in their introductions. A classmate mentioned how they felt a connection to me because we both played the piano and went to a music precollege for it. It was shocking to me that someone was actually <i>listening</i> to me – perhaps I felt more so because I kept thinking that no one understood me anyway, even if I spoke to them about my dad. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	And weird enough, with my first day of Freshman Composition, I thought: maybe my year won’t be so bad. <br><br>
 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Around a week into school, with the students (including myself) gradually getting used to classes, Mr. Henderson distributed the first book of the year: <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>. Now, my first impression upon hearing the title of our first book was, <i>what a bummer</i>. I had read the book in middle school, and I have my own copy of it. I did like it, but Holden wasn’t the best main character in my eyes, especially after I had gotten somewhere similar to his “phony” personality after losing my dad. There were several parts where Holden and I had alike thoughts, which I didn’t like – it just didn’t attract me, like how the same poles of a magnet try to push each other away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
	And that’s why I decided not to do the first few reading assignments. While everyone else was reading the chapters for homework, and got good grades on the reading review quizzes every day, I just left the closed book on my desk, and consequently failed the first few quizzes, since I didn’t remember the details that the questions asked.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	By that time, the typical Stuy kid’s fear of bad grades kicked my ass to get working. The obvious result was that I could now participate in discussions more and share the ideas I had with my classmates. I’m not the most talkative person, but after being given – rather, giving myself the opportunity to take part in the discussions more, I realized how grand<sup><b>5</b></sup> of an experience raising your hand and throwing out ideas to the class can be. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Re-reading the book and speaking in class also gave me a new perspective over the novel that I had thought I was familiar with. My interpretation of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> changed; rather than just looking at how phony Holden was, I focused more on his character development, and came to think that: if Holden was able to change so much, perhaps I, who had similar traits to Holden at the time, would be able to change too. Perhaps I would be able to break out of my isolated shell, stop looking at the world with such blank, negative eyes, and come to appreciate beautiful things as beautiful.<sup><b>6</b></sup><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


      If I was able to grab such a chance to change from a single book, maybe, just maybe, life wouldn't be so bad. </p>
