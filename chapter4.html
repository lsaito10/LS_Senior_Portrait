 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Having to write this senior memoir, I’ve come to realize one thing: I’m afraid. I’m afraid of writing down my experiences, my thoughts, my life – in my own words. I’m afraid of having people read them, and come up with whatever criticisms or opinions. I’m afraid of how people would look at me or view me after their lenses have been painted with the sentences and words that I have slammed in their faces through my writing. I’m afraid of having to revisit myself and review who I am as a person to write this whole thing. I’m afraid that in reality, I’m just an empty person – not a cup of water that’s half-empty or half-full, but full of pure nothingness – and that I really don’t have an identity. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	I’ve never liked myself. Actually, no, I probably did like myself more at one point, but after losing the better majority of my emotions along the way in my path to adultery because of the so-called traumatic experience I’ve gone through, I’ve lost the ability to “like” myself. Well, it’s more like I’m not interested in myself. <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	And perhaps because of that, I never really tried to express “myself” in my writing. I was allergic to having to put myself in a piece of literature.<sup> <b>1</b></sup> Sure, I’ve had past assignments and essays where I was asked to write a “personal essay.” But for those assignments, let me be honest with you: I wrote stories that mixed 50% of the truth with 50% of a lie, or wrote about insignificant experiences as if they were the greatest inspiration in my life (sorry past English teachers). I was always writing from the perspective of a character named Lynca, and not from my own.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 

      Don’t get me wrong; I love writing. I love writing fictional stories, analytical essays (though they take time), poems, and even research papers (to an extent). But those personal essays… they were an issue. Because they forced me to realize how shitty of a person I was. Because they forced me to realize how coarse my literary voice became when I had to speak about myself on paper. Because they forced me to realize how small and unimportant I felt in my story – how small I felt in <i>Lynca Saito’s</i> story, where I am supposed to be the main character.<sup><b>2</b></sup> <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	
      Perhaps that’s why I felt so relieved that this is my last “personal essay.” Because I don’t have to write about <i>The Brief Not-So-Wondrous Life of Lynca Saito</i>.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      But then again, there was a side in me that kept saying, <i>are you really okay with that? You’re sure that you want to end your last piece of writing with all lies, hiding in your own shadow?<sup> <b>3</b></sup></i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	No, I wasn’t okay with that. My senior portrait shouldn’t just be any kind of “personal” writing. It should define me as a person, because that’s what senior portraits are: not a mere story of me, but a representation of my entire four years as a high school student; a representation of  my growth. And that’s why I’ve written my chapters to be real. Maybe even up to the extent that they’re disgustingly real and too open, that I feel bare and stripped naked inside. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But having to write this senior memoir, I’ve come to realize one thing: I’m afraid. But I’m also satisfied. And glad. Even excited. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why? It’s simple. Way more simple than I had anticipated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It’s because along with my writing that’s full of my honest, true self, and sharing it with my fellow classmates whom I have spent the last four years with, I feel like I’m finally grasping onto something. Something precious. Something… <i>ah, I see. I’m finally grasping onto my identity. I’m gaining the opportunity to retrieve who I was before. </i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because I can read through my own writing, and see how much I have changed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because by looking into my own memories as I type these words, I can feel how much I actually value these memories<sup><b>4</b></sup>; how much I treasure them despite being stabbed in the back by them every now and then. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because (and I’m actually quite surprised by this) I understand that I do appreciate myself. I appreciate myself as a person. I appreciate all the experiences I’ve gone through. I appreciated the people who have helped me walk through my rocky, unorganized, zig-zagged road of life, full of obstacles.<br>

      <center>*****</center></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I was lost. Severely lost. My world completely lost its color after my dad was cremated into smithereens. <br>		 	 	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		
	Have I overcome my dad’s death? Perhaps not. There really is no way for someone who has lost a truly loved one to overcome such a tragic experience. I’ve lost much from my dad’s death. But, I’ve also gained much from it. I’ve become more mature. More reliable. More loving. More caring. I wouldn’t say I’ve overcome his death, but I would say that I am continuing to prop my foot forward, slowly and carefully. Accepting his death has given me the determination to overcome future obstacles that come my way. I will never be able to overcome his death, or the pain I experienced from it, in of itself. I don’t intend on “overcoming” it either. What I will overcome, however, is my weak self. I have been through the worst. Nothing can hurt me now.<sup><b>5</b></sup> <br>
    <center>~~~</center></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	My freshman self thought I had to strive to be a good person.<sup><b>6</b></sup> And well, I wasn’t such a good person. So I strayed away from crowds of people, from students in the hallways and staircases of Stuyvesant, not daring to make eye contact with anyone. And though I knew how much of a phony person I was, I was too scared to face the fact. Until. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Until I met Holden Caulfield, who just happened to be a ‘phonier’ person than I was. And as I watched Holden grow with the progression of The Catcher in the Rye, along with my classmates, I heard something click in me. A chance to change.	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Maybe it’s thanks to Holden (though I hate to admit it), that I now don’t force myself to be such a good person. It’s okay to be phony at times. And there are people who accept me for who I am. So, maybe it’s thanks to Holden that I’ve managed to avoid running away from people. Maybe it’s thanks to the book that I’ve managed to make some friends in school. 
          <center>~~~</center></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I had only played the piano as a mere instrument. I loved the instrument, and enjoyed performances, but that was it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	It was only after finding my own pack of wolves that I discovered more meaning to it, and even a goal. Through music, I’ve become a bit of a better person, who’s at least more willing to lend a helping hand to those in need. I now feel more connections between myself and the people around me through music, and enjoy being able to express myself through the 88 keys. <br>
          <center>~~~</center></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	At first, I didn’t like the idea of writing a senior portrait. No, not because it takes a lot of time and effort, but because I didn’t know how or what I should write about myself. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I first forced out ideas about what to write, and sighed every now and then as my fingers crawled along my laptop’s keyboard to type my portrait. But as I wrote more, went through peer edits, and read comments made by my classmates, I felt like more people were acknowledging me for who I am. I felt like I was acknowledging myself more for who I am. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	And though this may be the cheesiest way for me to end my senior portrait, I’m doing it anyway: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <i>Thank you. </i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For reading through this. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For getting to know who I am. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For helping me allow myself to be me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <center>*****</center></p>
   
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Whether you like it or not, this is me. This is my story.<sup><b>7</b></sup> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	And I can’t wait to add more pages to the story of my life as I enter the stage of my new adventure: college.
